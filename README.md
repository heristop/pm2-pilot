## Configuration Management

PM2 Pilot uses a unified configuration file in your home directory with **safe concurrent access**:

- **Location**: `~/.pm2pilot-config.json`
- **Features**:
  - **Thread-safe configuration**: Uses file locking to prevent corruption
  - **Atomic writes**: Prevents race conditions during config updates
  - **Auto-recovery**: Rebuilds corrupted config files automatically
- **Contents**:
  - AI provider selection (OpenAI/Gemini)  
  - API keys for each provider
  - Model presets and active selections
  - User preferences (auto-execute mode, verbosity, confirmation level)
  - Provider-specific configurations

This single file manages all PM2 Pilot settings with enterprise-grade reliability and concurrent access protection.

```bash
# View current configuration
> /ai config

# The config file structure:
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "userPreferences": {
    "autoExecute": false,
    "verbosity": "detailed", 
    "confirmationLevel": "destructive"
  },
  "openai": {
    "apiKey": "sk-...",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "activePreset": "fast"
  },
  "gemini": {
    "apiKey": "AI...",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"
  }
}
```

## 🤖 AI-First Interface Vision

PM2 Pilot is evolving toward an AI-native experience where natural language becomes the primary interface:

### Current Interface

```bash
> my app is slow
❌ Commands must start with /. Type /help for available commands.

> /ai my app is slow
🤖 AI Assistant is thinking...
[AI response without actions]
```

### Future AI-First Interface

```bash
> my app is slow
🤖 Analyzing your processes...
I can see that "my-app" is using 85% CPU and 420MB memory. This could be causing slowness.

Let me check the logs for errors:
[Automatically shows recent errors]

Suggestions:
• Restart the process: restart my-app
• Check memory usage: /metrics my-app
• Would you like me to restart it now?

> yes restart it
🔄 Restarting my-app...
✅ my-app restarted successfully
📊 New metrics: CPU 12%, Memory 89MB - much better!
```

### Natural Language Examples

```bash
# Process troubleshooting
> why did my-app crash?
🤖 Analyzing crash logs... Found memory limit exceeded at 2:34 AM
🔧 Suggesting: increase max_memory_restart to 800MB

# Batch operations
> restart all errored processes
🤖 Found 3 errored processes: api-server, worker-1, notifications
🔄 Restarting all... Done! All processes now online.

# Performance optimization
> optimize my cluster setup
🤖 Analysis: Your 4 instances are underutilized (avg 15% CPU)
💡 Recommendation: Reduce to 2 instances to save 180MB memory
🚀 Would you like me to scale down automatically?

# Learning and discovery
> how do I monitor memory usage over time?
🤖 I can help! Use `/history collect` to start tracking, then `/history` to view trends.
📊 Starting collection now... You'll have data in 30 seconds.
```
