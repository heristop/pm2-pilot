```

## Configuration Management

PM2-X uses a unified configuration file in your home directory with **safe concurrent access**:

- **Location**: `~/.pm2x-config.json`
- **Features**:
  - **Thread-safe configuration**: Uses file locking to prevent corruption
  - **Atomic writes**: Prevents race conditions during config updates
  - **Auto-recovery**: Rebuilds corrupted config files automatically
- **Contents**:
  - AI provider selection (OpenAI/Gemini)  
  - API keys for each provider
  - Model presets and active selections
  - User preferences (auto-execute mode, verbosity, confirmation level)
  - Provider-specific configurations

This single file manages all PM2-X settings with enterprise-grade reliability and concurrent access protection.

```bash
# View current configuration
pm2x> /ai config

# The config file structure:
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "userPreferences": {
    "autoExecute": false,
    "verbosity": "detailed", 
    "confirmationLevel": "destructive"
  },
  "openai": {
    "apiKey": "sk-...",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "activePreset": "fast"
  },
  "gemini": {
    "apiKey": "AI...",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"
  }
}
```

## ü§ñ AI-First Interface Vision

PM2-X is evolving toward an AI-native experience where natural language becomes the primary interface:

### Current Interface

```bash
pm2x> my app is slow
‚ùå Commands must start with /. Type /help for available commands.

pm2x> /ai my app is slow
ü§ñ AI Assistant is thinking...
[AI response without actions]
```

### Future AI-First Interface

```bash
pm2x> my app is slow
ü§ñ Analyzing your processes...
I can see that "my-app" is using 85% CPU and 420MB memory. This could be causing slowness.

Let me check the logs for errors:
[Automatically shows recent errors]

Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ Restart the process: restart my-app
‚Ä¢ Check memory usage: /metrics my-app
‚Ä¢ Would you like me to restart it now?

pm2x> yes restart it
üîÑ Restarting my-app...
‚úÖ my-app restarted successfully
üìä New metrics: CPU 12%, Memory 89MB - much better!
```

### Natural Language Examples

```bash
# Process troubleshooting
pm2x> why did my-app crash?
ü§ñ Analyzing crash logs... Found memory limit exceeded at 2:34 AM
üîß Suggesting: increase max_memory_restart to 800MB

# Batch operations
pm2x> restart all errored processes
ü§ñ Found 3 errored processes: api-server, worker-1, notifications
üîÑ Restarting all... Done! All processes now online.

# Performance optimization
pm2x> optimize my cluster setup
ü§ñ Analysis: Your 4 instances are underutilized (avg 15% CPU)
üí° Recommendation: Reduce to 2 instances to save 180MB memory
üöÄ Would you like me to scale down automatically?

# Learning and discovery
pm2x> how do I monitor memory usage over time?
ü§ñ I can help! Use `/history collect` to start tracking, then `/history` to view trends.
üìä Starting collection now... You'll have data in 30 seconds.
```
