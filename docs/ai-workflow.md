# AI-First Interface and Workflow

## Vision: AI-Native Process Management

PM2+ is evolving toward an AI-native experience where natural language becomes the primary interface for process management.

## Current vs Future Interface

### Current Interface

```bash
PM2+ my app is slow
❌ Commands must start with /. Type /help for available commands.

PM2+ /ai my app is slow
🤖 AI Assistant is thinking...
[AI response without actions]
```

### Future AI-First Interface

```bash
PM2+ my app is slow
🤖 Analyzing your processes...
I can see that "my-app" is using 85% CPU and 420MB memory. This could be causing slowness.

Let me check the logs for errors:
[Automatically shows recent errors]

Suggestions:
• Restart the process: restart my-app
• Check memory usage: /metrics my-app
• Would you like me to restart it now?

PM2+ yes restart it
🔄 Restarting my-app...
✅ my-app restarted successfully
📊 New metrics: CPU 12%, Memory 89MB - much better!
```

## Natural Language Examples

### Process Troubleshooting

```bash
PM2+ why did my-app crash?
🤖 Analyzing crash logs... Found memory limit exceeded at 2:34 AM
🔧 Suggesting: increase max_memory_restart to 800MB
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
PM2+ restart all errored processes
🤖 Found 3 errored processes: api-server, worker-1, notifications
🔄 Restarting all... Done! All processes now online.
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
PM2+ optimize my cluster setup
🤖 Analysis: Your 4 instances are underutilized (avg 15% CPU)
💡 Recommendation: Reduce to 2 instances to save 180MB memory
🚀 Would you like me to scale down automatically?
```

### Learning and Discovery

```bash
PM2+ how do I monitor memory usage over time?
🤖 I can help! Use `/history collect` to start tracking, then `/history` to view trends.
📊 Starting collection now... You'll have data in 30 seconds.
```

## Benefits of AI-First Approach

### Zero Learning Curve

Start with natural language immediately - no need to memorize commands or syntax.

### Contextual Actions

AI automatically includes current system state in responses and suggestions.

### Proactive Suggestions

Get optimization recommendations without explicitly asking for them.

### Intelligent Automation

AI executes common tasks with confirmation, streamlining workflows.

### Conversational Workflow

Build solutions through natural dialogue rather than isolated commands.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced AI Integration (Current)

- Robust slash command system
- AI assistant for analysis and suggestions
- Natural language processing for complex queries
- Context-aware responses

### Phase 2: Hybrid Interface (In Progress)

- Natural language input parsing
- Intent detection and action mapping
- Confirmation workflows for dangerous operations
- Smart defaults from conversation context

### Phase 3: Full AI-First Experience (Future)

- Natural language as primary interface
- Automatic action execution with safety checks
- Conversational process management
- Learning from user patterns and preferences

## Safety and Confirmation Framework

### Safety Levels

1. **Safe Operations** - Execute immediately (status, metrics)
2. **Moderate Risk** - Brief confirmation (restart single process)
3. **High Risk** - Explicit confirmation (restart all, delete)
4. **Destructive** - Multiple confirmations (force kill, remove config)

### Confirmation Patterns

```bash
# Low friction for safe operations
PM2+ check my app status
🤖 Here's the status for "my-app": online, CPU 15%, Memory 89MB

# Smart confirmation for moderate operations
PM2+ restart the slow app
🤖 I'll restart "api-server" (currently using 85% CPU). Continue? (y/N)

# Explicit confirmation for dangerous operations
PM2+ delete all processes
🤖 ⚠️  This will PERMANENTLY DELETE all PM2 processes.
Type "DELETE ALL" to confirm this destructive action:
```

## Context Management

### Conversation Memory

- Remember processes mentioned in conversation
- Track user preferences and patterns
- Maintain session-specific context
- Learn from successful resolutions

### Smart References

```bash
PM2+ check my api server
🤖 Showing status for "api-server"...

PM2+ restart it
🤖 Restarting "api-server"... # Remembers previous reference
```

### Context Hints

```bash
PM2+ the logs look weird
🤖 Which process logs? I see you have 3 running:
1. api-server (mentioned earlier)
2. worker-queue
3. notification-service
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Graceful Degradation

If AI services are unavailable:

- Fall back to traditional slash commands
- Provide helpful command suggestions
- Maintain full functionality without AI enhancement

### Smart Error Recovery

```bash
PM2+ start my app
🤖 "my-app" failed to start. Error: Port 3000 already in use.
💡 I can help fix this:
1. Kill the process using port 3000
2. Start "my-app" on a different port
3. Check what's running on port 3000
What would you like to do?
```

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Modal Interface

- Voice commands for hands-free operation
- Visual dashboards with AI insights
- Integration with monitoring tools

### Predictive Management

- Predict process failures before they happen
- Suggest optimizations based on usage patterns
- Automated scaling recommendations

### Team Collaboration

- Share AI insights across team members
- Collaborative troubleshooting sessions
- Knowledge base from AI interactions
